<h1>Using Mutt to send emails to mailing lists</h1>

    <div class="mind" id="m">
      <p>Please note that I have actually changed my mind on the role
	that the <code>Mail-Followup-To</code> hearder plays in this
	world.</p>
      <p>It is not a standard, and some people argue against it for
	good reasons (see an <a href="http://pm-doc.sourceforge.net/pm-tips-body.html#replyto_header">example of arguments against <code>Mail-Followup-To</code></a>). Until
	there actually is an RFC solving the problems
	<code>Mail-Followup-To</code> is trying to address, or a group
	of people working on it and making it fit in the rest of the
	electronic mail scenary (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt">RFC 2822</a> and
	friends), I am
	forced to see this header as a hack that can potentially do
	more harm than good.</p>
      <p>I am leaving this page here because I think that it is useful
	documentation, but I am now setting:</p>
      <blockquote>
<pre>set followup_to=no
set honor_followup_to=no</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I will be happy to be pointed to a place
	where such discussions happen.</p>
    </div>

<p>If you are in a hurry and want to see quickly what to put in your
<tt>.muttrc</tt>, go the <a href="#summary">example configuration</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am getting tired of receiving emails twice when somebody replies
to an email I sent to a mailing list (one copy for me, another one to
a mailing list).</p>

<p>As I explained in my <a href="http://larve.net/people/hugo/2000/03/email">email guidelines</a>,
people should preferably write to a mailing list unless they really
want to draw sombody's attention, in which case they can copy this
person.</p>

<p>Most mail user agents do not know how to deal with mailing
lists. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> does.</p>

<p>I want to summarize here how to configure Mutt to be able to send
email to mailing lists in an efficient way. If you want more
information about mailing list capabilities in Mutt, please have a
look at the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-3.html#ss3.9">configuration</a>
and <a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-4.html#ss4.8">advanced
usage</a> information in the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/">Mutt manual</a>.</p>

<p>I am talking here about mailing list support in Mutt version 1.2.4.</p>

<p>Mutt recognizes mailing lists in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user specified in his configuration that a particular address
was a mailing list.</li>
<li>a mail received contains a <a href="http://larve.net/people/hugo/2000/03/email#mft"><tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt> header</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><code>subscribe</code> and <code>lists</code></h2>

<p>You should tell Mutt about mailing lists you use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>subscribe</code>: you are subscribed to a mailing list.</p>
<p>For example, if you subscribed to <tt>coolstuff@lists.example.com</tt>, add
to your configuration:</p>
<pre>subscribe coolstuff@lists.example.com</pre></li>
<li><p><code>lists</code>: it is a list but you are not subscribed
too.</p>
<p>If you occasionnaly send email to <tt>bugs@lists.example.com</tt> but do
not receive it, you want to put in your configuration:</p>
<pre>lists bugs@lists.example.com</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>This allows you to use the <code>list-reply</code> function ('L'
key) to reply to a mailing list.</p>

<h2><tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt> header</h2>

    <div class="mind">
      <p>Please see <a href="#m">my comment about this hearder</a>.</p>
    </div>

<p>To tell people how to reply to an email you send to those mailing
lists, you must use a <tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt> header. In order to
do that, put in your configuration:</p>
<pre>set followup_to</pre>

<p>This will have the following effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>emails sent to mailing lists you subscribed to will be answered in the
mailing list (specified with <code>subscribe</code>) and not to you. With our
previous example, the following header will be used:</p>
<pre>Mail-Followup-To: coolstuff@lists.example.com</pre></li>
<li><p>emails sent to other mailing lists (specified with
<code>lists</code>) will be answered to the list and to you. Our
example would give:</p>
<pre>Mail-Followup-To: bugs@lists.example.com, your.address@your.domain.example.org</pre></li>
<li><p>the <tt>Reply-To</tt> field can be used if people want to reply
to you directly, keeping in mind that some mail user-agents force the
user to reply to the address specified in the <tt>Reply-To</tt>
field...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You must also tell Mutt that it should not ignore the
<tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt> header. This is done with:</p>
<pre>set honor_followup_to=yes</pre>

<p>That way, <code>group-reply</code>s and <code>list-reply</code>s
will use the information in the <tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt> field.</p>

<p>For example, doing a <code>group-reply</code> to an email sent by
<tt>user1@example.org</tt> to <tt>bugs@lists.example.com</tt> and
<tt>user2@example.org</tt> with the following headers:</p>
<pre>From: user1@example.org
To: bugs@lists.example.com, user2@example.org
Mail-Followup-To: bugs@lists.example.com, user2@example.org</pre>
<p>will send your mail to <tt>bugs@lists.example.com</tt>,
<tt>user2@example.org</tt> as specified by <tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt>,
but not to <tt>user1@example.org</tt>. The <tt>Mail-Followup-To</tt>
field set will include your address since you are not subscribed to
that list:</p>
<pre>From: your.address@your.domain.example.org
To: bugs@lists.example.com, user2@example.org
Mail-Followup-To: bugs@lists.example.com, user2@example.org,
	your.address@your.domain.example.org</pre>

<p>If the same email had been sent to <tt>coolstuff@lists.example.com</tt>
to which you subscribed:</p>
<pre>From: user1@example.org
To: coolstuff@lists.example.com, user2@example.org
Mail-Followup-To: coolstuff@lists.example.com, user2@example.org</pre>
<p>your reply would have been:</p>
<pre>From: your.address@your.domain.example.org
To: coolstuff@lists.example.com, user2@example.org
Mail-Followup-To: coolstuff@lists.example.com, user2@example.org</pre>
<p>in order to tell people not to copy you if they want to reply to
the list.</p>

<h2>Sample configuration</h2>

<p id="summary">The summary of the configuration in this example is:</p>
<pre># I subscribed to coolstuff@lists.example.com
subscribe coolstuff@lists.example.com
# I know that bugs@lists.example.com is a list, but I didn't subscribe to it
lists bugs@lists.example.com
# Please <a href="#m">see my comment at the top of this page about this</a>
set followup_to
set honor_followup_to=yes
</pre>

<p>You should really consider configuring Mutt like that in order to make
everybody's life easier.</p>
