           The &ldquo;<tt>locate .pem</tt>&rdquo; command
           may help you figure this out,

          >The <tt>c_rehash</tt> command is
           a Perl script that comes with the OpenSSL toolkit;
           it creates symbolic links to certificate files
           (with a &ldquo;<tt>.pem</tt>&rdquo; extension)
           using symlink names based on a hash of
           each certificate's whole subject name.
           Fetchmail uses the OpenSSL libraries
           and will only try to open the installed file by looking it up
           under the <tt>594f1775.0</tt> (or <tt>594f1775.1</tt> and so on)

           post-office-protocol version 3 (POP3) commands

           The contents of this file are documented
           by the fetchmail(1) man page,
           which can be consulted using
           the &ldquo;<tt>man fetchmail</tt>&rdquo; command.

           you can add similar three-line <tt>user</tt> subsections
           under this same <tt>poll</tt> section;
           the last two lines will redundantly be identical
           for every Gmail account.</p

           however, this shortcoming is <i>somewhat</i> mitigated
           by the MD5 fingerprint verification,
           at the price of a loss in unattended flexibility
           (should Gmail wish to change its
           <b>server</b> certificate for some unlikely reason).</p
        ><p
          >There is no need to inform fetchmail
           that the POP3-over-SSL (pop3s) TCP port is 995;
           it's smart enough to figure it out on its own.</p
        ><p
          >Note that POP3-over-SSL is not the same as regular (non-SSL) POP3
           with use of the <tt>STLS</tt> command and capability
