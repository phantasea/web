I am getting an error when I try to access my NTFS drive from ubuntu.

    I had this problem. It was because windows, being windows, decided
    to restart without asking me. When it restarts, it boots back up
    into linux. At that point, the drive was expecting to be restarted
    into windows and threw this error. – Marcel

If you can't access the drive, execute the following command:

|sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXY
|

where XY is the partition

e.g |sda2| or |sdb1|

Then, mount with:

|sudo mount -o rw /dev/sdXY /mounting point
|

Mounting point can be local or external drive (like a USB drive), e.g. |/media/YourUserName/MountingPointName|.

    This is the best solution if you can risk crashing of Windows. But
    for partitions other than the one on which Windows is installed,

    If you still get a problem after this (which is fine it's still
    moaning about hibernation) you can use |sudo mount -t nfts-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdXY /media/Windows| – Brian Sidebotham

I solved the problem with shutdown Windows by cmd

|shutdown /s
|

This is because Windows 8 and 10 offer a "Fast Startup" option that
depends on a "non-complete" shutdown

You can disable fast startup by following these steps under "Power Options"

    For this solution, you will have to first shutdown your Linux and
    then boot back into Windows and then do this thing, and then again
    boot back into Linux. – Muddassir Nazir

    Thanks! This worked for me. I wonder why this made a difference as
    opposed to a regular shutdown from Start --> Shutdown on Windows?

    @Jon: It's because |shutdown /s| performs a conventional shutdown. The shutdown via the GUI performs a |fast shutdown| for Windows 8 & 10, where it does something that's pretty much
    like a hibernation, so that startup and shutdown are fast.

If you have access to booting and mounting the drive under Windows, *do
as the message indicates* and remove it from the hibernation or fast
restarting, or any other special state. You would have to do those
things by booting into Windows.

You may also run chkdsk
<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee872425.aspx> on it from
Windows.

If you don't have immediate boot access under Windows for the drive, do
as the message says and mount it as read only.

Then access the drive and copy the important data. You can then repair
the drive under Ubuntu by reformatting the partition and bring the
backed up data back.

Mounting drive as read only:

|$ sudo mount -o ro /dev/[partition /media/[mounting point]
|

Another option is to repair the disk under Ubuntu with |ntfsfix|:

|$ ntfsfix /dev/[partition]
|

This is because your "Windows" system is in a intermediate state, may be
its in hibernation mode or not full shutdown, try a system restart on
your windows and shutdown the system fully and check the mount on your
Ubuntu, it should work.

This should be because your "Windows" system is in a intermediate state
(not a full shutdown of system before powering off the hard drive, like
using hibernation for example).

Restart on Windows, shutdown down system fully and it should work.

If you try this on a command line term session, you should have this
kind of explanation

Do:

|sudo mount -o ro /dev/[partition /media/[mounting point]
|

The output will be:

|The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. 
Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), 
or mount the volume read-only with the `ro` mount option.

Log on to windows and then restart to Ubuntu. Works for me! But
seriously I don't know whether there is a permanent solution to that.
