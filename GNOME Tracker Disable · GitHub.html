GNOME Tracker Disable
Raw

  Disabling GNOME Tracker and Other Info

<#disabling-gnome-tracker-and-other-info>

GNOME's tracker is a CPU and privacy hog. There's a pretty good case as
to why it's neither useful nor necessary here:
http://lduros.net/posts/tracker-sucks-thanks-tracker/
<http://lduros.net/posts/tracker-sucks-thanks-tracker/>

After discovering it chowing 2 cores, I decided to go about disabling it.


    Directories

<#directories>

|~/.cache/tracker
~/.local/share/tracker
|

After wiping and letting it do a fresh index on my almost new desktop,
the total size of each of these directories was a whopping 3.9 GB!


    Startup Files

<#startup-files>

On my Ubuntu GNOME setup, I found the following files:

|$ ls  /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-*
/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-extract.desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-miner-fs.desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-store.desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-miner-apps.desktop
/etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-miner-user-guides.desktop
|

You can disable these by adding |Hidden=true| to them. It's best done in your local |.config| directory because 1) you don't need sudo and 2) you are pretty much
guaranteed that your changes won't be blown away by an update.


    The |tracker| Binary

<#the-tracker-binary>

Running |tracker| will give you a vast array of tools to check on tracker and manage its
processes.

|$ tracker
usage: tracker [--version] [--help]
               <command> [<args>]

Available tracker commands are:
   daemon    Start, stop, pause and list processes responsible for indexing content
   info      Show information known about local files or items indexed
   index     Backup, restore, import and (re)index by MIME type or file name
   reset     Reset or remove index and revert configurations to defaults
   search    Search for content indexed or show content by type
   sparql    Query and update the index using SPARQL or search, list and tree the ontology
   sql       Query the database at the lowest level using SQL
   status    Show the indexing progress, content statistics and index state
   tag       Create, list or delete tags for indexed content

See 'tracker help <command>' to read about a specific subcommand.
|


    Non-Invasive Disable Cheat Sheet

<#non-invasive-disable-cheat-sheet>

This disables everything but |tracker-store|, which even though it has a |.desktop| file, seems tenacious and starts up anyway. However, nothing gets indexed.

|tracker daemon -t
cd ~/.config/autostart
cp -v /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker-*.desktop ./
for FILE in tracker-*.desktop; do echo Hidden=true >> $FILE; done
rm -rf ~/.cache/tracker ~/.local/share/tracker
|

Note that |tracker daemon -t| is for graceful termination. If you are having issues terminating
processes or just want to take your frustration out, |tracker daemon -k| immediately kills all processes.

After this is done, |tracker-store| will still start on the next boot. However, nothing will be indexed.
Your disk and CPU will be better for wear.

|$ tracker status
Currently indexed: 0 files, 0 folders
Remaining space on database partition: 123 GB (78.9%)
All data miners are idle, indexing complete
|

NB use at your own risk

seems you can prevent tracker-store from starting by deleting (or
backing up) /usr/lib64/systemd/user/tracker*.service
might be located elsewhere on your system
the files are called tracker-extract.service, tracker-store.service etc
at least tracker-store hasnt started since i killed those files. not
seen any ill effects including searcing in nautilus

this is a good tutorial but unfortunately this does not work for me. I
made a simple script to kill the trackers process. It will surely kill
the process before it exits. Here is the link: https://goo.gl/7A23fK

WOW I never noticed this had so much traffic! I hope that everyone found
it (somewhat) useful - I personally didn't intend it to be anything else
other than personal notes. But yeah all these comments withstanding this
is probably pretty out of date information. I actually switched to Arch
and i3 for a long time a few months after writing this and haven't
really bothered to touch it on my Fedora installs (I don't think I've
noticed anywhere close to the same performance hit that I think led me
to it in the first place).

You can use /Gnome Settings -> Search/ to disable or restrict tracker.
When you start that GUI it shows which applications not which file
system locations.
Click on the gear icon to access the controls for enabling/disabling
file system locations.
Unfortunately, when I use an sshfs mount inside my home directory
tracker access to it cannot be controlled via that GUI.

Can't live without tracker. With an SSD, if it takes more than momentary
time to index, there's something wrong. If it's chewing CPU, there's a
chance it's found a file that's breaking the indexer. You can find and
triage the offending file with this process:

Thanks for this gist, it was really useful, but please update it to use |tracker-*.desktop;| rather than |ls| since not everyone reads through all of the comments to find the
corrections. I've just had to manually remove the lines added to all of
my other |autostart| files.

The easy solution is to open /usr/lib/tracker/ and find the files
"tracker-miner-fs" and "tracker-store" select properties and under the
Permissions tab un-select the "Execute: [] Allow Executing file as a
Program". With out this property the programs will not load.Problem
solved. This could also be done in a command line. "chmod -x
/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-store" and "chmod -x
/usr/lib/tracker/tracker-miner-fs" and could be made not to change these
attributes with the "chattr +i" to add immutable. There are two other
files in this directory I did this to but I am not sure of the necessity
of changing them

@nilands55s <https://github.com/nilands55s> your solution and in

    Another option: in Ubuntu, one can use this GUI
    <http://askubuntu.com/a/499777/18682>. If it's not installed
    already, just do |sudo apt-get install tracker-gui|.

For whatever reason, this package is not (yet?) available in Ubuntu
19.04, where I'm having this problem.

|for FILE in `ls`; do echo Hidden=true >> $FILE; done|

Should be changed to the following to prevent it from adding
"Hidden=true" to the end of any files already existing in
~/.config/autostart :

|for FILE in tracker-*.desktop; do echo Hidden=true >> $FILE; done|

I really wish tracker would skip indexing files can't be indexed with
minimal cpu or memory. I understand that the goal is to index
everything, but I'd rather it skip some file that requires even just
512MB of memory or more than a second of 100% cpu usage (even if it
legitimately those resources to index the file). Worse, there isn't any
obvious user-facing feedback that tracker is the cause (short of top or
system monitor) and/or which file is causing the problem. I think
tracker would be nice if they sorted out these issues.

I can't believe that this is still being used! I've updated it with the
oft mentioned fix to the pretty obvious oversight with the blind |ls|.

Again, I haven't touched or used this in years, and never messed with it
on my most recent Fedora installs. YMMV.

I think Ubuntu 19.04 was the first Ubuntu distribution to include
tracker. This probably increased the number of tracker users in recent
months and caused some of the interest in this. For me, there is(are)
some file(s) that tracker occasionally touches that makes my machine
crawl until the OOM killer decides to kill tracker. I don't know the
tracker details, but it seems to regularly occur when I run a script
which touches a lot of the files in my home directory.

I've always been a GNOME guy, but I'm beginning to dislike GNOME in
certain specifics if not in general, because of unnecessary (to me)
tools like this (to be fair, these tools are appreciated and desired by
some, apparently). I'm very thankful that this has been provided.

Interesting (possible new) quirk on a fresh install of Pop!_OS 19.10:
I have an |sshfs| automount (through |fstab|) drive with ~80000 files, and even if I let it finish (15-30min,
resulting in |Currently indexed: 108823 files, 28495 folders|), it will completely drop all that metadata on the next reboot
(resulting in |Currently indexed: 149 files...|)
Currently watching all the logs as well as |/tmp/tracker-extract-files.1000/|, but preliminary results are not promising.

Ubuntu 20.04 user here. I tried all of these and still, the damn tracker
was using 100% of a CPU core none stop. I look for over an hour, trying
all the answers I could find. At the end, I had enough. I deleted the
autostart files and rebooted the computer:
|$ sudo rm /etc/xdg/autostart/tracker*|
Still, the damn tracker process was sucking up my CPU. I can't uninstall
the sucker since that would uninstall Ubuntu desktop binaries, so I
deleted the tracker binaries and rebooted:
|$ sudo rm /usr/libexec/tracker*|
That did the trick. It's a radical solution, I know. I would not
recommend anyone to do this, but it does work.

    Nowadays you can disable Tracker easier, by masking its systemd
    services, see here
    <https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/07/how-to-completely-disable-tracker.html>

👍 , thx @logix2 <https://github.com/logix2>

Testing with the directories and it works (stop increasing the disk usage):

|$ du -shc .cache/tracker/
380K	.cache/tracker/
380K	total

$ du -shc .local/share/tracker/
84K	.local/share/tracker/
84K	total
|

also, if you're confortable with terminal, I strongly recommend:

  * |fzf| <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf> to search patterns on filenames
  * |ripgrep| <https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep> to search patterns over
    files content

      Ubuntu 22.04 (workaround to disable Tracker3)

To disable Tracker3 on Ubuntu 22.04 and avoid updates:

sudo apt-mark hold tracker
sudo apt-mark hold tracker-extract
sudo apt-mark hold tracker-miner-fs

sudo chmod -x /usr/libexec/tracker-extract-3
sudo chmod -x /usr/libexec/tracker-miner-fs-3

tracker3 reset --filesystem --rss # Clean all database
tracker3 daemon --terminate

To undo:

sudo apt-mark unhold tracker
sudo apt-mark unhold tracker-extract
sudo apt-mark unhold tracker-miner-fs

sudo chmod +x /usr/libexec/tracker-extract-3
sudo chmod +x /usr/libexec/tracker-miner-fs-3

tracker3 daemon --start

This solution is a workaround. But it works.

If you want to check all settings of Tracker3 for the current user, run
the command:

gsettings list-recursively | grep Tracker3

In this settings it is possible to enable or disable the Tracker3 for
specific directories.

This makes it so that Nautilus crashes if you attempt to search
anything. Beware

Hi, @fir3-1ce <https://github.com/fir3-1ce> ! In fact... But I find
another solution:

*Step 1*

systemctl --user mask tracker-extract-3.service tracker-miner-fs-3.service tracker-miner-rss-3.service tracker-writeback-3.service tracker-xdg-portal-3.service tracker-miner-fs-control-3.service

*Step 2*

tracker3 reset --filesystem --rss

*Step 3*
Reboot the system
