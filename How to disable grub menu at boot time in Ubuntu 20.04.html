I have installed Ubuntu 20.04 alongside Windows. When I boot the system,
it shows the grub menu for 10 seconds to choose between Ubuntu and
Windows. I don't want that menu, just want to boot it up right after
pressing the power button. I have looked into this
<https://askubuntu.com/questions/111085/how-do-i-hide-the-grub-menu-showing-up-at-the-beginning-of-boot> thread and added |GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true
| and even changed |GRUB_TIMEOUT| to |0| and then ran |sudo update-grub|. But it didn't work, menu is still being shown at boot time. This is my |/etc/default/grub| file-

    Solution / tl;dr

|echo 'set timeout_style=hidden
set timeout=0' | sudo tee /boot/grub/custom.cfg
|


    Explanation

Though UnKNOWn's approach <https://askubuntu.com/a/1239911/1121259> does
indeed work, the modification of files installed by the base system
should be avoided, if possible. In this case (i. e. Ubuntu 20.04),
apt-file shows that |/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober| belongs to the package |grub-common| (this is also true for /all/ files located in |/etc/grub.d/|, which are used by the |update-grub| command to compile the final GRUB configuration file):

Output of "apt-file search /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober"
<https://i.sstatic.net/q2T6Z.png>

If the package |grub-common| gets updated in the future, apt would detect the change and prompt you
to decide what it should do (as both options - the file modified by you
as well as the unmodified file from the distributor - are valid). In the
worst-case scenario you would have to compare and merge the file
contents manually.

So, what are our options if we want to hide the GRUB menu in a multiboot
environment? For once, the |grub-common| package only wants to make sure that each and every user can switch
between the installed operating systems. Because of that, the script |/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober| contains the following code snippet:

|adjust_timeout () {
  if [ "$quick_boot" = 1 ] && [ "x${found_other_os}" != "x" ]; then
    cat << EOF
set timeout_style=menu
if [ "\${timeout}" = 0 ]; then
  set timeout=10
fi
EOF
  fi
}
|

This script (which is evaluated once the |update-grub| command gets executed) basically allows you to set a custom timeout
even for multiboot environments - but it will not allow a timeout of 0,
as novice users would perhaps not know how to boot their other operating
systems without an obvious menu. This means that you could set |GRUB_TIMEOUT| to 1, and so the GRUB menu would show up for just a second before
booting the default boot option.

But how can we hide the GRUB menu for good without touching files
installed by system packages? Luckily, the |grub-common| package provides a facility to apply one-off settings. Have a look at
the last file evaluated by the |update-grub| command, |/etc/grub.d/41_custom|:

|#!/bin/sh
cat <<EOF
if [ -f  \${config_directory}/custom.cfg ]; then
  source \${config_directory}/custom.cfg
elif [ -z "\${config_directory}" -a -f  \$prefix/custom.cfg ]; then
  source \$prefix/custom.cfg;
fi
EOF
|

OK, so a file named |custom.cfg|, which must be placed in the same location as the actual GRUB
configuration file (|/boot/grub/grub.cfg|), gets sourced every time the GRUB configuration file gets evaluated
(/i. e. at boot time/). So let us add our desired settings to this file (|/boot/grub/custom.cfg|):

    GRUB will now hide the menu and instead boot the default boot option
    immediately. Other operating systems can still be booted by using
    the UEFI.

    Can you explain a little bit "Other operating systems can still be
    booted by using the UEFI." Is there another way to select boot OS?

    Well, many UEFI implementations are able to list the available
    operating systems (since all of them will store the files required
    for their boot process on a common ESP, short for EFI System
    Partition). Most of the time they will also allow you to select the
    operating system that should boot from this list once you have
    entered the UEFI user interface. Note that the steps needed to enter
    the UEFI user interface differ between vendors and implementations.
    Most of the time you will have to press Escape, Delete or one of the
    function keys on system startup. – opx

*Tested with Dual boot of 2 Ubuntu 20.04 OS'es*

Edit the below line in the file |/etc/default/grub| file

|GRUB_TIMEOUT=10
|

like this

|GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
|

and run the below command

|sudo update-grub
|

this makes the timeout to 0 with condition that if there is Single OS it
will stick to 0 otherwise it will be overwrite to 10.

In the |/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober| file, change the line

|quick_boot="1"
|

to

|quick_boot="0"
|

This will prevent in multi OS'es cases from changing the timeout value
to 10seconds..

see the function "adjust_timeout" from the file |/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober|

|prefix="/usr"
exec_prefix="/usr"
datarootdir="/usr/share"
quick_boot="1"

export TEXTDOMAIN=grub
export TEXTDOMAINDIR="${datarootdir}/locale"

. "$pkgdatadir/grub-mkconfig_lib"

found_other_os=

adjust_timeout () {
  if [ "$quick_boot" = 1 ] && [ "x${found_other_os}" != "x" ]; then
    cat << EOF
set timeout_style=menu
if [ "\${timeout}" = 0 ]; then
  set timeout=10
fi
EOF
  fi
}
|

When you want to see grub menu, pressing the |Esc| key at rite time will show you. (rite time varies based on conditions,
generally after the BIOS menu hand overs to grub menu time)

In case if you wish to change Default OS, you can set from the same file |/etc/default/grub|.

for the first time, get to the grub menu by hitting |Esc| at the rite time. Then count the number starting from 0 from top to
list your favorite OS Entry..

For example, I have two 20.04 OS'es.. one in |/dev/sda2| and other in |/dev/sda6| |/dev/sda2| is the default one. If I want to make the one in |/dev/sda6| as the default OS, I need to find its number like below..

enter image description here <https://i.sstatic.net/In8AR.jpg>

So, its position is at number 2.

Edit the file |/etc/default/grub| and change the line

|GRUB_DEFAULT=0
|

to

|GRUB_DEFAULT=2
|

then run the below command

|sudo update-grub
|

System will boot straight to Ubuntu 20.04 on |/dev/sda6|

As of ubuntu 22.10 i recommend this:

edit the file /etc/default/grub:

|sudo nano /etc/default/grub
|

Make sure you have this lines:

|GRUB_TIMEOUT=0
GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=0
|

Save and exit run updater:

|sudo update-grub
|
