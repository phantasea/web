<H1>Mail Filtering with Procmail</H1>
This document is meant as a gentle introduction to the use of
<I>Procmail</I>.  It was last updated on <I>22 September 1997</I>, but
it's been some time since I've added groundbreaking new content.  If
you have suggestions for new material, drop me an email! <P>

<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> (9/30/2003) It's hard to believe, but I still
get Procmail questions from readers of this tutorial, after six years!
At this point, most of the questions I get are about how to filter
spam with Procmail.  I've included <a href="#antispam">some links</a>
on this issue at the end of the tutorial.</blockquote>

Please feel free to mail me concerning questions, additions, or
corrections.<P>

Since there seems to be a bit of confusion on this point, I didn't
write Procmail.  I wish I had, since it's a fine piece of software,
but I only wrote this tutorial.  I am not a source for Procmail
software distributions, or for help on compiling or installing it.
You can 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/">
get the software via FTP</A>, and you should find manual pages and
such with the distribution there.  Once you've got Procmail set up (or
confirmed that it is already set up at your site!), come on back and
follow this tutorial. <P>

<H2>What is it?</H2></A>
Procmail is a program for filtering electronic mail.  It is very
useful for presorting and preprocessing large amounts of incoming
mail.  You can use it to sort out mail from mailing lists, to dispose
of junk mail, to send automatic replies, or even to run a mailing
list.<P>

You control Procmail yourself, through a file that you put in your
home directory.  This Web page will guide you through the complexities
of writing this file.<P>

This web page is meant to cover the basics.  First, I'll walk through
a <A HREF="#gettingstarted">sample filter setup</A>.  After that, I'll
build a set of filters from scratch as a <A HREF="#tutorial">tutorial</A>.  
This should be sufficient to get you up and running, using most of
Procmail's normal features.<P>

Procmail has several manual pages (online help); their titles and how
to read them is discussed <A HREF="#what_now">at the end</A>.  I've
also included links to a couple spam-filtering utilities; for more,
you might try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=spam+filter+procmail">
Googling for "spam filter procmail"</a><P>

<HR>
<A NAME="gettingstarted">
<H2>Getting Started</H2></A>
This document is geared towards using Procmail on the student and
faculty systems at UMBC (i.e., UMBC7, 8, or 9, or the general-use
workstations).  If you're planning on using Procmail on a different
system, you should consult your system administrator.  You can find a
link to the Procmail ftp site <A HREF="#what_now">at the end</A> of
this file.<P>

Currently, these UMBC systems are already running Procmail.  All you
need to do is compose a special file, called <I>.procmailrc</I> (don't
forget that leading dot!), which describes the sorting criteria.  Once
you have this file in your $MAIL directory, Procmail will automatically
be run on any incoming mail you receive.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Side Note -- a bit of Unix trickery</I><P>
Files in Unix that begin with a dot '.' are <I>hidden</I> files.  So,
when you use the <CODE>ls</CODE> command to view the files in your
home directory, you may not see the .procmailrc file, or any other
so-called "dot-files", right away.  To see hidden files in your
directory, use the '-a' option, as in <CODE>ls -a</CODE>.  The '-a'
stands for "all files," and will show you both hidden and visible
files in one listing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The whole trick to Procmail is writing the .procmailrc file.
However, to the beginner, the format may look like some magical
incantation, so I'll start with a small example (actually, an excerpt
from my personal .procmailrc!) and walk through it.  This is going to
entail discussion of a lot of particulars and details, but don't
worry; if things seem to digress or just plain stop making sense, odds
are they'll be explained more fully later.  After that, I'll construct
a new .procmailrc, tutorial-style. <P>

<A NAME="example">
Sample <CODE>.procmailrc</CODE>:</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
# .procmailrc
# routes incoming mail to appropriate mailboxes
PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
MAILDIR=$HOME/.mailspool   # all mailboxes are in .mailspool/
DEFAULT=$HOME/.mailspool/ian
LOGFILE=/dev/null
SHELL=/bin/sh

# Put mail from DC-Linux mailing list into mailbox dclinux
:0:
* ^(From|Cc|To).*dc-linux
dclinux

</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now, don't panic, it's not as bad as it looks.  A .procmailrc has two
parts, <I>assignments</I> and <I>recipes</I>.  The assignments set up
variables so that Procmail knows where programs and mailboxes are;
that's the top part.  The recipe is the incantation at the bottom.
Anything preceeded by a hash mark (#) is a <I>comment</I>, and is
ignored.<P>

<A NAME="assign">
<H3>Assignments</H3></A>
The assignments section tells Procmail where to find things, such as
your mailboxes, or programs that it might need to run.  The set of
assignments above pretty much cover what most users should need; the
full set is discussed in the <I>procmailrc</I> man page.<P>

Here are descriptions of the assignments in the excerpt above.  They
take the format <I>variable-name</I> = <I>value</I>.
<DL><DT><PRE>PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin</PRE>
<DD>This tells Procmail where to look for other programs.  Here at
UMBC, the procmail programs are in /usr/local/bin.  I also have /bin
and /usr/bin here, for programs that might be run from there.
Directories are separated by colons.
<DT><PRE>MAILDIR=$HOME/.mailspool   # all mailboxes are in .mailspool/</PRE>
<DD>MAILDIR is the location of your mailboxes.  $HOME stands for your
home directory; therefore, this points to the .mailspool directory in
my home directory.  Most users have this directory, containing their
incoming-mail folder, however, you should probably double-check that
the directory exists.
<DT><PRE>DEFAULT=$HOME/.mailspool/ian</PRE>
<DD>DEFAULT is the default place for Procmail to put your mail; this
should be your regular incoming mailbox.  For me and most users, this
is $HOME/.mailspool/ian (except with your username); but it could be
something else, such as $HOME/.Maildrop.
<DT><PRE>LOGFILE=/dev/null</PRE>
<DD>This specifies the name of a file to use as a usage log, to which
Procmail will write any diagnostic or error messages during its
activity.  In this example, logging is being done to /dev/null, which
is kind of a system black-hole for dumping unwanted data; no logs will
be kept by this .procmailrc file.  As an example, the following
LOGFILE assignment creates daily logs with the appropriate date, using
the UNIX <I>date</I> command:
<DD><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>LOGFILE=$MAILDIR/log.`date +%y-%m-%d`</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>These logs would go in the same place as the mailboxes, specified
above in the MAILDIR assignment.  Logs can be useful for tracking down
errors; use them with new recipes, then delete them when you know they
work.
<DT><PRE>SHELL=/bin/sh</PRE>
<DD>This defines a shell, or operating environment, for Procmail to
run other commands in.
</DL>

<A NAME="recipes">
<H3>Recipes</H3></A>
OK, now with that boring stuff out of the way, now we can get on to
the interesting part -- recipes.  Recipes are where the real work of
filtering is done.  Things can get kind of complex here, but bear with
the details for now... the tutorial afterwards should clear up any
remaining fuzziness.<P>

Recipes have the following format:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
:0 [<I>flags</I>] [: [<I>lock-file</I>] ]
zero or more <I>conditions</I>
one action line
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The flags and lock-file business I'll cover later.  The idea is that
if the conditions are met, the action is performed.  Now, let's look
again at the simple recipe from above, which filters my mail from a
DC-area Linux users group into it's own mailbox:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
# Put mail from DC-Linux mailing list into mailbox dclinux
:0:
* ^(From|Cc|To).*dc-linux
dclinux
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The action line in this case is simple: it's just 'dclinux,' the name
of the folder to put the mail into.  The action could also be an
address to forward the mail to, or a program to start, or even a block
of commands.  We'll see more complex examples later.<P>

The condition tells Procmail what to look for in a mail message.  They
begin with a '*', and the rest is a <I>pattern</I> to look for.  If
part of the message matches this pattern, then Procmail will apply the
action.  The pattern is called a <I>regular expression</I>, and takes
some explaining.  To briefly translate before I dive in, this pattern
translates to:
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<I>at the beginning of a line, 'From' or 'Cc' or 'To', followed by
some number of characters, followed by 'dc-linux'.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, this pattern would match messages with 'dc-linux' in the From,
Cc, or To lines of the header.  Neat, huh?<P>

Most .procmailrc files have more than one recipe.  The rule is, unless
you tell it otherwise, Procmail will stop at the first recipe that
matches the message.  I'll show how to get around this in the 
<A HREF="#tutorial">tutorial</A>.

<A NAME="regexps">
<H3>Regular Expressions</H3></A>
Regular expressions are actually reasonably simple, once you get the
hang of them.<P>

First and foremost, any character that isn't a special character
mentioned below matches itself.  This includes all letters and
numbers, and some punctuation.  That is to say, the regular
expression 
<PRE>	Bob</PRE> 
matches the string "Bob".  In Procmail, regular expressions are
<I>case insensitive</I>, so this will also match "bob", or "bOb", or
"BOB", for that matter.   <P>

A dot '.' matches <I>any character except a newline</I>.  So, the
expression 
<PRE>	.ob Jones</PRE> 
will match the string "Bob Jones", but
also "Rob Jones" and "Qob Jones", too.<P>

Any character followed by a star '*' matches that character repeated 0
or more times.  Thus, 
<PRE>	Bob* Jones</PRE>
matches "Bo Jones", "Bob Jones", or "Bobbbbbbbbbb Jones".  The
expression ".*" matches any number of unspecified characters.<P>

Related are the '+' and '?' modifiers.  The expression <CODE>"a+"</CODE>
matches <I>one or more</I> a's.  The expression <CODE>"a?"</CODE>
matches <I>zero or one</I> a.<P>

You can use parentheses to group an expression for use with a
modifier.  So, the expression
<PRE>	B(ob)+</PRE>
matches "Bob", and also "Bobobobobobob".<P>

If one character in a pattern could be one of several, you can use a
<I>character class</I>.  For example:
<PRE>	Part [abcd]</PRE>
matches "Part a", "Part b", "Part c", and "Part d".  If the first
character of a class is '^', the class matches anything _not_ in the
class.  For example:
<PRE>	[^aeiou]+</PRE>
matches any series of one or more non-vowel characters.<P>

One more operator is the '|' (vertical-bar) character.  It is used to
match either of two expressions.  For example:
<PRE>	Bob|Joe</PRE>
will match "Bob" or "Joe".<P>

The last two special characters I want to mention are '^' and '$'.
Incidentially, here I'm referring to a '^' that <I>isn't</I> inside a
character class.  '^' means the beginning of a line, and '$' means the
end of one.  So,
<PRE>	^To:</PRE>
would match the letters 'To:' at the beginning of a line.  If that
looks suspiciously like part of a mail header, consider it a preview.
;-) <P>

This comprises most of the special characters that Procmail uses in
regular expressions.  There are a few others, but the 
<A HREF="#what_now">manual pages</A> for <I>egrep</I> and
<I>procmailrc</I> explains them as well, and if I'm not careful this
will turn into a help sheet on regular expressions!<P>

Now, what is all this about <I>matching</I>, anyway?  Well, now you
should be able to see that your regular expression recipe represents a
pattern in a mail message.  We will use regualr expressions to tell
Procmail what patterns to look for.  Next, I'll walk through the
construction of several recipes, and you'll see how it's done.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="tutorial">
<H2>Recipe Concoction Tutorial</H2></A>

Now, let's construct a .procmailrc file as we might in real-life.
Hopefully this will make a lot of the cluttered details up above make
a little more sense.  For other examples, read the <I>procmailex</I>
<A HREF="#what_now">manual page</A>.<P>

We're going to use the same assignments section as described 
<A HREF="#assign">above</A>.  Unless you have your mailbox in an odd
place, or want to use logs, you'll probably find what I've included
to be just fine.<P>

Let's say we belong (as I do) to the mailing list Israeline, which
sends out daily news clipping collections from Israeli news sources.
It might be nice to automatically have these digests automatically
placed in a special mail folder, which we'll call 'israel'.<P>

Mail from this list comes addressed like so:
<PRE>To: Multiple recipients of list &lt;israeline@nysernet.org&gt;</PRE>
This has changed in the past, but it always has that address in it, so
we'll use part of that as our pattern.  Our pattern will be to match
"a line starting with 'To:' and containing 'israeline'", or
<CODE>^To:.*israeline</CODE>.  The recipe will look like this:
<PRE>
:0:                # the last colon means use a lockfile
* ^To:.*israeline
israel             # put these messages in the 'israel' folder
</PRE>

One thing to remember, by the way, is don't put any comments on a
condition line.  If you do, Procmail will think the comment is part of
the pattern!<P>

Ok, now what's all this about a 'lockfile'?  Well, suppose two
israeline messages came in at about the same time.  It's very possible
that the mail system would fire up two copies of Procmail, and each
would try to write its message to your 'israel' folder!  By using a
lockfile, the first Procmail that gets run will 'lock' the folder so
only it can write to it; any other Procmail trying to write to that
folder will have to wait until the first is finished.  Using lockfiles
may slow down your mail delivery ever so slightly, but it's better
than mangled mail.<P>

Now, suppose your colleague Bob likes to send you lists of jokes that he
finds around the Net every so often, usually with "joke" or "funny" in
the subject line.  We don't want this frivolity cluttering our
otherwise clean, businesslike work mailbox, so we'll forward it to our
account at the university.  The tricky part is we want to make sure we
don't forward Bob's vital business memos too.  We'll use two
conditions in the recipe; one to match mail from Bob, and one to match
the subject.  Here's how the recipe looks:
<PRE>
:0  # forward jokes to my wossamatta u. account
* ^From.*bob
* ^Subject:.*(joke|funny)
! rocky@wossamatta.edu
</PRE>

Three things to note here.  First, forwarding mail is done with the '!'
at the beginning of the action line, followed by the address.  Second,
notice that I don't have a colon after 'From' in that condition.  This
is a quirk of mail headers; there are header From lines with and
without colons, so leaving it off is the safest bet.  Third, since
we're just forwarding the mail and not writing to a file, we don't
need a lockfile.<P>

Of course, even though I'm sending the joke mail off somewhere else,
I'd still like to read the jokes, even if they're not in my mailbox!
We could print out those messages, as well as forwarding them; that
way we could read them and no one would know...<P>

The new thing here, besides having an action run a program, is that
we're going to modify the above recipe so we have two actions.  We'll
do this with a technique called <I>nesting</I>.  Here's the modified
recipe:
<PRE>
:0:  # forward jokes to my wossamatta u. account
* ^From.*bob
* ^Subject:.*(joke|funny)
{
  :0 c
  ! rocky@wossamatta.edu

  :0
  | lpr -Pacsps
}
</PRE>

Instead of an action line, we're using a nested <I>block</I>, which is
enclosed in braces.  This block is like a secondary .procmailrc file;
in it, we can put any number of recipes, which will only be used if
the 'parent' recipe applies.<P>

The first recipe in the block is to send off the mail.  It uses a flag
in its first line, a 'c'.  The 'c' flag means to <I>copy</I> the mail,
so that the next recipe also gets a copy of the mail, since
ordinarily, mail only goes to the first recipe that fits it.  The 'c'
flag allows us to apply two recipes to a single message.<P>

We send a message to a program using the vertical bar '|' symbol to
start off the action line.  This means "send the message as input to
the following program."  In Unix this is called a "pipe".  So, here
we're piping the mail message to the program "lpr", which will print
the message on the printer "acsps".<P>

In a similar way, let's archive the messages we get from another
mailing list, called (let's say) "junk".  So, while we deliver the
messages to our mailbox, we'll keep the body of the messages in a
compressed file, which we could unpack later.
<PRE>
:0 bc:   # archive things sent to junk mailing list
* ^To:.*junk
| gzip >> junk-archive.gz
</PRE>

Here we're using two flags.  The 'b' flag means that the action line
will just take the body of the message, and not the header.  The 'c'
line, again, means to just take a copy of the message for this recipe,
and pass it along to the recipes after.  We're using that because we
want to archive the message, but we'd also like it to be filed in our
mail inbox as usual.<P>

The pipe is another Unixism, telling Procmail to send the message to
the compression program "gzip", which will squash the text and put it
at the end of the file "junk-archive.gz".  This file can be
uncompressed for later reading with the "gunzip" command, like so:
<PRE>	gunzip junk-archive.gz</PRE>

This covers most of the basic recipes that one might create.  The
limit from here is only your own needs.  The manual pages (described
below) will be your best course now.  The page called
<I>procmailrc</I> describes all the flags you can use, and the page
called <I>procmailex</I> contains more examples.<P>

As a sort of quiz, look at the following recipe of mine and try to
figure out what it does.  I used it as the first recipe in my
.procmailrc when I went traveling recently:
<PRE>
:0 Wc: vacation.lock
|/usr/sbin/vacation ian
</PRE>

<I>(hint: look at the manual page for the program 'vacation', and also
look at the example in 'procmailex' about sending automatic
replies)</I>

<HR>
<A NAME="what_now">
<H2>What Now?</H2></A>
Everything you can do with Procmail isn't explained here.  Once
you've read this document and practiced a bit, though, you can also
refer to the <I>man pages</I>.  Man pages are on-line help; typing 
<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>man</STRONG> <I>topic</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <I>topic</I> is usually a command name.  Procmail has several
man pages which explain aspects of the program:

<DL>
<DT><I>procmail</I>
<DD>The basic description of the program.  It discusses options to the
procmail program, and has a couple examples at the end.
<DT><I>procmailrc</I>
<DD>Detailed description of the format of the .procmailrc file, which
controls all the filtering.
<DT><I>procmailex</I>
<DD>Several working examples of .procmailrc entries.  A very useful
resource.
<DT><I>procmailsc</I>
<DD>Discusses weight-scoring, a technique for very expert-level
filtering.
</DL>

So, for example, to read the <I>procmailex</I> man page, one would
type
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>umbc9[1]% <I>man procmailex</I></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The regular expressions used by Procmail are the same as those used by
the Unix program <I>egrep</I>; these in turn are an extension of the
set used by <I>ed</I>, a time-worn editor program.  <I>ed</I>'s man
page is the online bible for regular expressions.  <I>egrep</I>'s man
page discusses the extensions.  The <I>procmailrc</I> man page gives a
summary.<P>

Procmail is written by Stephen R. van den Berg, at RWTH-Aachen,
Germany.  The latest version can be found at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/">
ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de</A> <P>

Also, the <A HREF="news:comp.mail.misc">comp.mail.misc</A> newsgroup
occasionally has traffic on Procmail and mail filtering in general. <P>

<a name="antispam"><b>(added 9/2003)</b></a>
I get a lot of questions on spam filtering with
Procmail.  I don't recommend trying to write individual scripts by
hand... the spammers are too good, and you'll spend all the time you
save writing new Procmail scripts.  Instead, you should consider using
an external filter, whose output you can process with Procmail.  Here
are a couple spam-filtering (and generic filtering) packages you can
easily use along with Procmail, and which will do a much better job
than hand-tuned filtering scripts.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>ifile</b> (<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ifile/"> 
http://www.nongnu.org/ifile/</a>)
<dd> I put this first because it's what I currently use.  ifile is a
generic email filtering program which can be used to filter out spam,
or even sort all your incoming mail.  It uses the now-well-known
"Naive Bayes" algorithm to learn what features "look like" spam.
(When someone in the spam filtering community finally discovers SVMs,
and codes them up as efficiently as ifile does, let me know.)  There
is a link here which describes how to use ifile with Procmail.
<br>
<dt><b>SpamAssassin</b> (<a href="http://spamassassin.org/"> 
http://spamassassin.org/</a>)
<dd>This is one of the best rule-based spam filters.  Their web page
tells how to use it with Procmail.  If you are at UMBC (which I'm not
anymore... if this doesn't work, ask systems@umbc.edu, not me),
SpamAssassin is already set up and ready to use.  See
<a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/systems/spamassassin.html">
http://www.csee.umbc.edu/systems/spamassassin.html</a> for local
details.
