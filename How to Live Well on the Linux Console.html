<p>I do much of my programming on a laptop without a graphical environment
installed, and rarely ever type <code>startx</code> on my desktop system. My console setup
is quite nice, and while it&#8217;s not for everyone, if you often find yourself
opening xterm windows to do most of your work, you might be interested in
dropping all that excess baggage and slimming down your system. There&#8217;s plenty
you can do in a terminal, so saddle up and get ready to give a big screw-you to
the overweight <span class="caps">GPU</span>-sucking graphical environments of the 21st century and take
a trip slightly back in time to back when things were&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, misuse the word <em>terminal</em> (and sometimes also
<em>console</em>) to refer to terminal emulators rather than a straight-up text mode.
This confusion of terms is usually not that big a deal, but to clarify, I&#8217;m
expressly discussing how to get along with a system where X11 isn&#8217;t installed
<em>at all</em> &#8212; and how to make yourself comfortable in such an&nbsp;environment.</p>


<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="framebuffer">Framebuffer</h3>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re using a reasonably recent Linux distribution, your text mode
might already be using a framebuffer, and chances are, it might even be decent.
Getting things configured is system-dependent and beyond the scope of this
post, but there are plenty of resources on getting a reasonably performing
framebuffer regardless of your particular setup. Check for
<code>/sys/class/graphics/fb0/name</code>, though; if that file exists, then
congratulations: you have a framebuffer, and it even has a&nbsp;name!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using the standard <span class="caps">VESA</span> <span class="caps">VGA</span> driver, you might find that scrolling
output, like paging through a man page, is hideously slow. In that case, your
framebuffer sucks. Chances are good it&#8217;s just not optimized by default; try
adding <code>video=vesa:mtrr=3,ywrap</code> to your boot line and see if that changes
anything. Regardless, you might be better off looking into an accelerated
framebuffer driver that&#8217;s actually designed for your&nbsp;card.</p>
<p>You might want to investigate <code>fbset</code>. Some drivers allow you to change the
resolution on the fly, among other settings. Others (like <span class="caps">VESA</span>) aren&#8217;t so&nbsp;snazzy.</p>
<p>You will (probably) also need to add your user to the &#8220;video&#8221; group for
framebuffer-based applications to function, and probably also&nbsp;&#8220;input&#8221;.</p>
<h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3>
<p>Getting away from that <span class="caps">VGA</span> <span class="caps">BIOS</span> look just takes a quick <code>setfont</code>, and can help
a lot in making your system not look like you just fished it out of the trunk
of an &#8216;85 DeLorean. Many Linux systems already use somewhat nice-looking
defaults; in particular, Ubuntu has a very nice console&nbsp;font.</p>
<p>Most of the fonts in the <code>kbd</code> package are kind of same-ish, but there are a
few interesting ones (and by &#8220;interesting&#8221; I don&#8217;t necessarily mean&nbsp;&#8220;readable&#8221;):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>972.cp</code></li>
<li><code>iso01-12x22</code></li>
<li><code>cybercafe</code></li>
<li><code>gr737b-9x16-medieval</code></li>
<li><code>t</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Alexandre de Verteuil has assembled <a href="https://alexandre.deverteuil.net/pages/consolefonts/">a nice gallery of the <code>kbd</code>
fonts</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a variant of Terminus in there, but if you enjoy that font,
chances are you&#8217;ll find the whole package far more appealing since it offers
many more sizes, variations, and character sets. At least on Arch, the X11 and
console fonts are bundled together, so installing it yanks in a ton of extra
dependencies, which is kind of annoying, but you can always extract the <code>.psf</code>
files out by&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>Depending on your distro, you might also be able to find some good fonts by
searching your package manager for &#8220;console font&#8221; or similar. I grew up with
Slackware, which had
<a href="http://slackware.cs.utah.edu/pub/slackware/slackware-13.0/source/a/kbd/sources/extraf.tgz">a heap of extra fonts</a>
that I got attached to; you might like some of them&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>You could also install my font tool
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Storlek/gnacc">gnacc</a> and edit a font to your liking, or
even try your hand at making your own. It&#8217;s a bit rough around the edges, but
it works fairly&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to gloss over character sets, as Linux distros tend to default
the console to Unicode mode nowadays and unless you have some reason to edit
stuff in some other encoding, you probably won&#8217;t need to change that. However,
if you handle a lot of different languages, you&#8217;re still quite likely to come
across missing glyphs. It&#8217;s just a matter of fact; on the console, you have <em>at
most</em> 512 characters to work with, and that just doesn&#8217;t cut the mustard in
this day and age. Historically, with <span class="caps">VGA</span> hardware you even had to choose
between more characters and more colors, because the 9th bit of the foreground
color doubled as a &#8220;switch character set&#8221; bit. This meant that if you had a
512-character font, you could only really use 8 foreground colors! Thankfully,
framebuffer modes eliminate this problem as they are fully capable of
supporting bigger fonts without a loss of color precision. There aren&#8217;t a whole
lot of 512-char fonts,&nbsp;though.</p>
<h3 id="side-quest-fbterm">Side quest:&nbsp;fbterm</h3>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking, &#8220;ew! This sucks!&#8221; Why yes it does. Since
you&#8217;re restricted to &#8220;just&#8221; a couple hundred characters, you&#8217;re out of luck if
you want even remotely decent Unicode support. There&#8217;s no TrueType fonts, no
antialiasing, ugh gosh this is just terrible&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>You guessed it, there&#8217;s an answer: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbterm/">Fbterm</a>.
Install that, get a couple nice monospace TTFs, spend a few moments reflecting
on the manual page and tap out an <code>.fbtermrc</code>:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span><span class="na">font-names</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">Inconsolata,Symbola</span>
<span class="na">font-size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">16</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Fbterm supports 256 colors, too, but you have to <code>export TERM=fbterm</code> after
you start it, which is a bit wonky. You can hack around that with some
cleverness, and after you get it working, it&#8217;s great, and you get just
as solid glyph coverage as you would in X11 since it uses&nbsp;fontconfig.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not for everyone, though. I spent quite a bit of time stuffing all sorts
of odd glyphs into my custom console font, so I rarely need more glyphs than it
provides, and none of my usual programs make use of the larger palette. I keep
Fbterm for viewing Asian text, or if I come across some odd Unicode that isn&#8217;t
rendering&nbsp;properly.</p>
<h3 id="color-schemes">Color&nbsp;schemes</h3>
<p>There are a few different ways to change the terminal colors. On the console,
the &#8220;best&#8221; way is by using <code>setvtrgb</code>, because that way, even if you do a full
console reset, your color scheme sticks. (This also can be annoying if you&#8217;re
not expecting it, but it&#8217;s easy enough to undo with <code>setvtrgb vga</code>.) It wants
its input in a really weird format, plus practically everyone makes their color
schemes for xterm and family, so you&#8217;ll probably want a&nbsp;converter.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Storlek/palette">my palette tool</a>, mostly because
I&#8217;m not aware of anything else that does quite what it does: it can read colors
from a variety of different file formats, and it works with <code>setvtrgb</code> as well
as terminfo-style control codes to set the palette in the best way available.
Plus, it has a handful of color schemes available out of the&nbsp;box.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to generate your own color scheme,
<a href="https://ciembor.github.io/4bit/">4bit</a> might be a good starting point. Just
export as an .Xresources file, save it into <code>~/.config/palettes/mytheme</code>, and
run <code>palette mytheme</code>.&nbsp;Presto.</p>
<h3 id="spiff-up-the-cursor">Spiff up the&nbsp;cursor</h3>
<p><em>(Note that fbterm doesn&#8217;t support this at all, which is kind of a&nbsp;bummer.)</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a colorful cursor for some time, and have gotten quite used to it. It&#8217;s
not quite as distracting as a blinking underline, and a bit easier to see &#8212; well,
in my opinion; of course, this is entirely&nbsp;subjective.</p>
<p>Primary reading:
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/VGA-softcursor.txt"><span class="caps">VGA</span>-softcursor.txt</a>.</p>
<p>I just played with the numbers until I found something I liked. It seems to be
a bit wonky in plain text mode, but it&#8217;s a solid, colorful block in a&nbsp;framebuffer.</p>
<p>If you just echo the softcursor control string, you&#8217;ll see the changes, but the
moment a program tries to set the cursor size, your nice software cursor will
disappear. To fix that, change the termcap settings to add your control string
to <code>cnorm</code>:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span>$ infocmp linux &gt; foo
<span class="c1"># edit foo and adjust the cnorm definition:</span>
<span class="c1">#   clear=\E[H\E[J, cnorm=\E[?25h\E[?113;0;220c, cr=^M,</span>
<span class="c1">#                                    ^^^^^^^^^</span>
$ tic foo <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> rm foo
<span class="c1"># then log out and back in</span>
</pre></div>


<p>My profile script also has a <code>tput cnorm</code> to set the cursor up when I log&nbsp;in.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-the-mouse">Set up the&nbsp;mouse</h3>
<p>By default, you might not have any mouse support. If you&#8217;re used to xterm,
you&#8217;re probably missing mouse paste, and even if not, some programs do use the
mouse in text mode, so let&#8217;s get it&nbsp;running:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span>$ sudo gpm -m /dev/input/mice -t imps2
</pre></div>


<p>This ought to work well enough for typical cases. By default, though, gpm maps
right-click to paste, and if you&#8217;re <em>really</em> used to middle-click, you can
switch it with the <code>-3</code> option. I don&#8217;t bother, because my laptop only has two
buttons&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;re using systemd, of course, you can use that&nbsp;too.)</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-customizations">Keyboard&nbsp;customizations</h3>
<p>If your biggest complaint is that left and right alt are different, try
<code>loadkeys linux-with-two-alt-keys.inc</code>. I&#8217;d also suggest loading <code>compose.inc</code>,
which turns print screen into a compose key, <code>unicode.map</code> to enter Unicode
character U+<span class="caps">NNNN</span> with Ctrl-Shift-<span class="caps">NNNN</span>. Have a look through
<code>/usr/share/kbd/keymaps</code> for others; there are many choices, including a wealth
of alternate keyboard layouts. <code>man loadkeys</code> has a rundown of the file format,
and <code>showkey</code> can clue you in on the keycode&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>My own keymap does plenty, including getting rid of caps lock, reassigning the
Windows keys to something better, adding Unicode hex input, and adding some
additional character sequences. Here&#8217;s the bit from my config to get alt-arrow
keys working as&nbsp;expected:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span>string F103 = &quot;\33\33[A&quot;
string F105 = &quot;\33\33[D&quot;
string F106 = &quot;\33\33[C&quot;
string F108 = &quot;\33\33[B&quot;
alt keycode 103 = F103
alt keycode 105 = F105
alt keycode 106 = F106
alt keycode 108 = F108
</pre></div>


<p>I only bothered with the key sequences I tend to use, but with some work, it
would probably be possible to add everything X11&nbsp;supports.</p>
<h3 id="tmux">tmux</h3>
<p>Lastly: in case you don&#8217;t already have it, I <em>highly</em> recommend installing
<a href="https://tmux.github.io/"><code>tmux</code></a> and making yourself at home with it. In fact,
I&#8217;d suggest that even when you&#8217;re in X11, or if you&#8217;re working over ssh, or
pretty much all the time. It&#8217;s a godsend. It permits you to do more than one
thing at a time, flip between tasks with tabs, and even split your screen into
windows like a (tiling) graphical <span class="caps">WM</span> would. It also has a ton of configuration
options, so I&#8217;d suggest spending a rainy afternoon fiddling with the&nbsp;settings.</p>
<h2 id="actually-doing-stuff">Actually doing&nbsp;stuff</h2>
<p>Okay, enough setup. Let&#8217;s actually get something&nbsp;done.</p>
<h3 id="video">Video</h3>
<p>You can set the volume with <code>alsamixer</code> (or <code>amixer</code> if you like that better).
Simple enough, and you probably knew&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>For playing stuff, I typically use <a href="http://mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a>. It&#8217;s
straightforward, displays subtitles, reads DVDs, handles streaming, has a nice
on-screen display, and plays damn near everything I&#8217;ve ever thrown at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Add this to your <code>~/.mplayer/config</code>:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Output to the framebuffer</span>
<span class="na">vo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">fbdev2</span>
<span class="c1"># Options particular to the fbdev2 video driver follow.</span>
<span class="c1"># Don&#39;t put general options after here.</span>
<span class="k">[vo.fbdev2]</span>
<span class="c1"># Without this, the constant status line updates will</span>
<span class="c1"># trample all over the video, causing flicker.</span>
<span class="na">quiet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">1</span>
<span class="c1"># Make it fill the screen, scaling up or down as needed.</span>
<span class="c1"># Adjust to your framebuffer&#39;s width; it&#39;ll scale the height.</span>
<span class="na">zoom</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">1</span>
<span class="na">xy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">1024</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure that the combination of <code>-zoom</code> and <code>-xy</code> is the best way to scale
videos, but I don&#8217;t know of a better way. (Dunno why it doesn&#8217;t just size them
automatically, though; it knows how big the framebuffer&nbsp;is!)</p>
<p>If MPlayer isn&#8217;t your cup of tea, <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"><span class="caps">VLC</span></a> also
works in the console, also plays a lot of file formats, and has a nice
command-line interface, but it&#8217;s a bit fiddly as you kind of have to blindly
type commands over top of the video as it&#8217;s playing, and it stretches videos to
the full size of the screen by default, which isn&#8217;t so great if what you&#8217;re
playing doesn&#8217;t match your display&#8217;s aspect ratio. I might have overlooked a
setting or six,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>If you want to browse YouTube, check out
<a href="https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer"><code>youtube-viewer</code></a>. It has a
surprising number of features, and it uses MPlayer for playback (with a
setting for using <span class="caps">VLC</span>&nbsp;instead).</p>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p>I actually use MPlayer for audio, too. (Yes, it even plays tracker music, using
libmodplug.) As with video, <span class="caps">VLC</span> is another good choice; try them both and stick
with what you&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>If you want something more audio-focused with a nice interface, try
<a href="http://www.cubic.org/player/">Open Cubic Player</a>, or perhaps
<a href="https://moc.daper.net/"><code>moc</code></a>.</p>
<p>For writing music, I&#8217;d be remiss not to point out that my own
<a href="http://schismtracker.org/">Schism Tracker</a> works nearly as well
in a framebuffer as it does in X11.&nbsp;:)</p>
<h3 id="images">Images</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.kraxel.org/blog/linux/fbida/"><code>fbida</code></a> gives you <code>fbi</code> and <code>fbgs</code>,
an image and <span class="caps">PDF</span> viewer, respectively. It also has <code>exiftran</code>, a neat tool for
manipulating JPEGs, and <code>ida</code>, a basic image editor (which, alas, needs&nbsp;X11).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="http://s-tech.elsat.net.pl/fbv/"><code>fbv</code></a>, but I have had weird
issues with it, like not drawing parts of images. (Workaround: <code>fbv -cik</code>,
which instead leaves junk on the screen.) On the other hand, <code>fbv</code> happily runs
from within tmux, whereas <code>fbi</code> complains if it&#8217;s not directly on a&nbsp;tty.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d rather do things the hard way, you could also do something like this
to view your&nbsp;images:</p>
<div class="hl"><pre><span></span>$ mplayer -really-quiet -idle mf://somefile.jpg
</pre></div>


<p>See, I told you MPlayer can do everything! You can even configure it to show
images in a slideshow; how to do this is left as an exercise to the reader.&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t do much image editing on the console, but for simple cropping and
resizing, ImageMagick&#8217;s <code>convert</code> gets me about 90% there. I&#8217;m not sure what
framebuffer-based drawing or editing apps there are, if any. For text art,
though, definitely check out <a href="http://aewan.sourceforge.net/">Aewan</a>. All I&#8217;m
going to say: layers. It has layers. It&#8217;s like Photoshop for&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>Taking a screenshot is simple enough: <code>cp /dev/fb0 screen.dump</code>. If you want to
do it all proper-like, though, try <a href="http://fbgrab.monells.se/"><code>fbgrab</code></a>. I
have a keybinding in tmux to fire off a script that snaps a screenshot and
tosses it in my &#8220;screenshots&#8221; folder with a&nbsp;description.</p>
<h3 id="office-stuff">Office&nbsp;stuff</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there&#8217;s no PowerPoint-ish application that runs on a
framebuffer, but you could just as easily make &#8220;slides&#8221; out of a pile of images,
and simply toss them at an image&nbsp;viewer.</p>
<p>Word processing software is looking somewhat dismal too. You might have luck
with <a href="http://cowlark.com/wordgrinder/">WordGrinder</a>, but from what I
understand, it&#8217;s in a very alpha state, so be ready for it to crash
spontaneously. Alternately, you could just write Markdown; many editors provide
reasonable syntax highlighting. (In fact, that&#8217;s exactly how I wrote this&nbsp;post!)</p>
<p>If your only interest is beating a Microsoft Word document into something
kinda-sorta readable, there&#8217;s the blast-from-the-past converter,
<a href="http://winfield.demon.nl/">Antiword</a>.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets are about the only thing that <em>really</em> has good console support,
and that&#8217;s with good ol&#8217; <code>sc</code>, or the more feature-filled <code>sc-im</code>. It has been
around since the dark ages and is worth another post in&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t found a calendar application that really does everything I
want. <a href="http://calcurse.org/"><code>calcurse</code></a>, which might be more than enough for
you. It doesn&#8217;t seem to support syncing with remote sources or managing
multiple calendars, though, and I use the heck out of Google Calendar. If those
things aren&#8217;t that important to you, it might be just right. (I started
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/Storlek/tical">writing my own</a>, but quickly got
frustrated with all the intricacies of the iCal format. Perhaps one day I&#8217;ll
pick it up&nbsp;again.)</p>
<h3 id="internet">Internet</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard of Lynx, but there&#8217;s more to offer. My personal favorite
text-mode browser is <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/"><code>w3m</code></a>, which supports
drawing images on the console and has many nice features. (If it isn&#8217;t showing
you images, make sure <code>w3m -V</code> contains <code>image</code>, and also check to see if you
have <code>imlib2</code> installed. Some distros do weird&nbsp;things.)</p>
<p>A lot of people seem to prefer <a href="http://elinks.or.cz/"><code>elinks</code></a>, which
supposedly supports JavaScript, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and images, but I could never get it to
work&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Gmail user, you might be pleased to find that the &#8220;basic <span class="caps">HTML</span> view&#8221;
is actually surprisingly usable in w3m. As far as native clients go, though,
the best choice is probably <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a>, but you&#8217;ll have to
spend some time getting familiar with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an <span class="caps">IRC</span> user, you&#8217;ve surely already heard of
<a href="http://irssi.org/">Irssi</a>.</p>
<p>I understand that there&#8217;s <em>supposedly</em> some decent console-based Twitter
clients, but save for the command-line examples in <a href="http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/">Python Twitter
Tools</a>, none of them have felt right and
worked properly for me. I tend to use Twitter&#8217;s mobile web interface in <code>w3m</code>
most of the&nbsp;time.</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>Whoever said Linux has no games?&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>You probably know <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a> already. It&#8217;s been around
for a long time and is quite popular. I&#8217;ve played it, but could never really
get into it. Just not my style, I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a ton of little historical (as in 1970s!) gems in the <span class="caps">BSD</span> games
package; on Arch it&#8217;s named <code>bsd-games</code>. Of note, there&#8217;s a few text
adventures, including the classic <a href="http://rickadams.org/adventure/">Colossal Cave
Adventure</a>, <a href="http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=247">Hunt the
Wumpus</a>, and a
lesser-known game, Battlestar; some more action-oriented titles, like <code>snake</code>
(which is probably <em>not</em> the snake game you&#8217;re thinking of), <code>worm</code> (this <em>is</em>
the one you were thinking of), <code>robots</code>, and of course, Tetris; board games
like backgammon and cribbage; and a few other brain-engagers, like <code>boggle</code> and
<code>quiz</code>. These are all black-and-white, <span class="caps">ASCII</span>-based games, and are definitely
showing their age, but they&#8217;re still&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>If you like arcade games, you might want to check out
<a href="http://ninvaders.sourceforge.net/">nInvaders</a>, or the technically impressive
<a href="http://raffi.at/view/code/aop">Ambassador of Pain</a>, written in a whole 64
lines of code (!). I also made <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Storlek/tetris">my own Tetris
clone</a> which offers more niceties than
the <span class="caps">BSD</span>&nbsp;version.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/enigma/">Enigma</a> is a charming,
deceptively challenging puzzle game. I&#8217;m not sure I have ever finished it, but
it hasn&#8217;t stopped being fun. From what I understand,
<a href="http://www.level7.org.uk/chroma/">Chroma</a> is a sort of continuation of this
game, but I couldn&#8217;t get it to&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>For a game to &#8220;show off&#8221; to gamer weenies, check out
<a href="https://github.com/cymonsgames/ASCIIpOrtal">Ascii Portal</a>. By default, it uses
PDcurses wrapped in an <span class="caps">SDL</span> layer, which does work in a framebuffer, but
that&#8217;s kind of convoluted and ridiculous. Fortunately it also happily builds
against ncurses (just <code>make nosdl</code>, or <code>make nosdl32</code>). The wealth of bundled
maps should last you quite a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>Speaking of <span class="caps">SDL</span>, though, it&#8217;s quite popular in game development, which means in
theory you should be able to run plenty of games in a framebuffer, as long as
they aren&#8217;t doing weird and sneaky things with X11. I haven&#8217;t investigated
this, though, so you&#8217;re on your own to explore the&nbsp;possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p>X11 is overrated. Text-mode programs are cool. Framebuffer-based programs are
super cool. That is&nbsp;all.</p>
